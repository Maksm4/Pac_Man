    OVERVIEW
This project is my adaptation of Pac Man game implemented in java with graphical user interface using swing. Before starting the game you need to choose how big of a map would like like to play on this time(columns/rows). The games purpose is to 
collect all of the coins displayed on your map, while avoiding the ghosts. After getting hit by a ghost 3 times or collecting all the coins the game is over 
and you are asked for your nickname that will be stored using serialization in the txt file highscores.txt implemented in HSManager class.
